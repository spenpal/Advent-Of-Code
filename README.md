# Advent of Code

I started doing Advent of Code in hopes of becoming a better Python programmer than the year before. Feel free to check in on my progress and how my code has evolved over time! I am constantly learning new ways to program in Python, and using efficient and interesting tricks to make my code more readable, writeable, and exploit a faster runtime. You might find a thing or two that you have never seen used practically in Python before ðŸ‘€...

I've posted all my solutions and the instructions of each puzzle to the best of my ability. I don't use comments for the majority of my code, as I believe the code should be well written enough that it explains itself (*at least in the context of knowing the puzzle*).
